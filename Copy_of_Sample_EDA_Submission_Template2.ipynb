The histogram shows the frequency of different rating values while the KDE curve provides a smooth estimation of the density. Since ratings are continuous numerical data, this chart allows us to easily observe the skewness, concentration, and spread of the ratings, giving a clear picture of how users are rating apps on the Play Store."

This suggests that app size doesn’t negatively impact user ratings, and in many cases, larger apps may even be associated with better user experiences, possibly due to more robust features or smoother functionality. However, smaller apps (under 20MB) show a much wider spread in ratings, including a significant number of low-rated apps.
